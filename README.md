# TomatoLeafAI
TomatoLeafAI is an intelligent web application designed to detect diseases in tomato leaves using deep learning. The system leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the PlantVillage dataset to classify tomato leaf images into ten categories, including healthy leaves and nine common tomato diseases.
Users can simply upload a photo of a tomato leaf, and the model will provide:
The predicted disease class with confidence scores
Detailed information about the disease
Suggested treatment methods for managing the disease
The project integrates Gradio for an interactive web interface, making it easy for farmers, gardeners, and agricultural professionals to quickly diagnose and take action. This tool helps in reducing crop loss, improving plant health management, and promoting sustainable agriculture.
Key Features:
Real-time leaf disease detection
User-friendly interface for easy image upload
Informative guidance on disease symptoms and treatments
Powered by a deep learning CNN model for high accuracy
